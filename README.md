Hi there! My name is Seungmin Yoo [sʰɯŋ.min.ju]

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in [linguistics at Seoul National University](https://linguist.snu.ac.kr/en/). 

I'm currently deeply interested in 
- Syntax
- Formal semantics (I love lambda calculus notation so much!)
- Phonology
- Corpus linguistics
- Graphematics

As my understanding of linguistics is still developing, I'm currently exploring a wide range of topics within the field. 

## Language
Basically, I'm a bye-lingual.

- Intermediate level - Korean, English

- Elementary level - Arabic, Japanese, Chinese

I am currently studying Arabic, Manchu and Japanese! I think their scripts are super cool.
