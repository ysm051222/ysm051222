Hi there! My name is Seungmin Yoo [sʰɯŋ.min.ju]

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in [linguistics at Seoul National University](https://linguist.snu.ac.kr/en/). I'm currently deeply interested in syntax, formal semantics (I love lambda calculus notation so much!), phonology, and graphematics. 

As my understanding of linguistics is still developing, I'm currently exploring a wide range of topics within the field. 

Since my Korean name is quite complicated, you can call me Kwukwuco [ku.gu.d͡ʒo] or yoo [ju]

## What does Kwukwuco stand for?
It means phrase structure in Korean as used in terms like [Phrase structure rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_rules) or [Head-driven phrase structure grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-driven_phrase_structure_grammar). 

it is pronounced [ku.gu.d͡ʒo]. If you cannot read [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), you can read it as... *cook-a-jaw*. That's quite horrible though.

## Language
Basically, I'm a bye-lingual.

- Intermediate level - Korean, English

- Elementary level - Arabic, Japanese, Chinese

I am currently studying Arabic, Manchu and Japanese! I think their scripts are super cool.
