## Hi there! 
My name is Seungmin Yoo[sʰɯŋ.min.ju]

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in [linguistics at Seoul National University](https://linguist.snu.ac.kr/en/). I'm currently deeply interested in minimalist syntax, graphmatics and semantic analysis using typed lambda calculus. As my understanding of linguistics is still developing, I'm currently exploring a wide range of topics within the field. 

Since my Korean name is quite complicated, you can call me by Kwukwuco [ku.ku]
